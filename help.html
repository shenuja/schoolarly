            <a href="#">What is the best way to track examinations in Schoolarly?</a>
        </li>
        <li class="answer" style="display: none;">
            <p>A good way to track examinations is to create them as activities in the group. Go to the group page and click on "Activity" in the right bar. 
Enter a title and description and leave "Invite student submissions" unselected. Enter the date and time of the examination and the total score it'll be graded for.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of tracking examinations as activities is that they automatically show up in the calendar of each student (To check out your calendar, go to "Events" tab). 
They also show up in the group calendar (Go to group page and click on "View Calendar" on the right bar). Also, once the examination is complete, you can edit the examination activity and upload the question paper into it. 
If you are interested, you could scan the student answer paper and submit it against each of their name so that they can refer to it later. You can also enter a score for the exam and later use it in reports. (See reports in advanced section)</p>

            <p>We encourage institutions to use the rubric system while grading assignments and exams because it gives excellent feedback to the student about the grading process itself. 
You can create a rubric by clicking on the Rubrics tab and "Create rubric" link on the right side. A rubric allows you to define different criteria for assessing something and various scales for placing each criterion on. 
In Schoolarly, you can edit a rubric to add criteria and levels of your choice.</p>
